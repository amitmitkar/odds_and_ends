clang_func_decl
=============

Simple function comment generator
that you can plug into vim / emacs.

eg : Given a function prototype like below. 

int func(int a, int b) 
{

Generates the comment block below.  

/* Name   : func
 * Desc   :
 * Return : Int
 * Params :
 * a :
 * b :
 */

==================
Usage : 

In vim I can do the above by going to the line with the function declaration 

Assuming the cursor was on the function declarationi in the example above,
the following  incantation ":.,+1 !./func_decl -" 
will change the function prototype into a comment block.

Make sure the range includes the opening brace of the function definition or the 
semi-colon if its simply a declaration.

======================
Building :

Just run make. You make have to change the -L parameter to 
specify the path to libclang.so if you are on a 64 bit box or not.

Installing clang and clang-devel packages is a prerequisite.
